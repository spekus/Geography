# Geography
It is a little app which displays all countries and allows user to read basic information about them.

Bellow is a gif showing the basic app features.

First it shows how the app makes toast message if the user launches it for the first time without internet.
Then it shows how the app works with an internet connection and finally it shows that the app can work without an internet connection if it has already downloaded all required data once before.
